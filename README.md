# Unlocking LG's 845 device with just 1 click lol(or maybe more)

Supported phones:

* LG G7 supported (except T-Mobile).

Extract it in main C: drive. Directory should be like this after extraction: C:\Unlock845\


USAGE:

1 - Reboot the phone in EDL mode

2 - Double click on Unlock.bat then enter your COM port (if your port is COM6 then type 6, 11 then type 11, same with others.). After that press on Enter

3 - Wait for the tool run itself and when it's done follow the guide and reflash the KDZ.

Voila! Your bootloader got unlocked!

Although V40 and V35 should be supported once the tool is stable enough cause the unlock guide is the same but I didn't have time to download the firmware one by one to get their abl lol. Thanks for reading.
