# Unlocking LG's 845 device with just 1 click lol(or maybe more)

So, these are the firmware will be supported soon:
* G710EM30f
* G710ULM30f (if you crossflashed it with EM firmware on ULM/VM devices)
* G710AWM30d / 30b (it's ULM when you crossflashed it with ULM/VM devices)
* G710N30g / 30d (it's NULM when you crossflashed it with AWM/EM firmware in G7 Korean's model, and vice versa)
* G710EMW30e (I need tester on this so yeah.)

Planning to support Android 9 or 8 either. But i'll try

Although V40 and V35 should be supported once the tool is stable enough cause the unlock guide is the same but I didn't have time to download the firmware one by one to get their abl lol. Thanks for reading.
